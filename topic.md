# To Eject the USB Device or Not, That is the Question?
Many times we see ourselves faced with the challenge of using an additional 5 seconds and three clicks to properly eject our USB device. Though it seems frivolous for some to debate doing it, is it actually required. while many people agree that not following these steps rarely if ever hurt your USB device, there still are some risks. These risks include corrupting transferd file, not completing transfered file , and lastly but rarely corrupting the entirety of the USB device. This risk is most closely associated with your computers ability to use "write cache" it is a temporary copy of your original file that is then moved to the USB device. This ability can be disabled in Window computers but is always enabled on MACs making Apple users more prone to corrupted data. When clicking the properly eject option it completes the transfer and deletes the temporary file, though the file usually completes before you press this option it is recommended by USB device manufactures to use this process. In conclusion it isn't completely necessary especially for Windows users but whats an additional thre clicks of your mouse for a peace of mind?
