### About Me
The words above accurately describe myself, I'm David Lopez. I am a man who is so mythical in all my crafts that to most people I have become a legend. I am a pizza devouring, gym rat going, world traveling, comic loving person, with a thirst for knowledge. I enjoy this class so far and hope to learn more.
