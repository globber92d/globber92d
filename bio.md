### About Me
The words above accurately describe myself, I'm David Lopez. I am a man who is so mythical in all my crafts that to most people I have become a legend. I am a pizza devouring, gym rat going, world traveling, comic loving person, with a thirst for knowledge. I enjoy this class so far and hope to learn more.  
### Hobbies
One of my favorite hobbies is to embrace my nerdy side. This includes hunting nerd cultural gems to include comics, toys, and replicas. I have a large collection now that I haven's displayed in years due to the sheer volume. Fortunately I have still been collecting till date. So my collection continues to grow and won't be displayed until I purchase a new home within the states. Additionally learning toy history is another hobby that got me hooked on hunting some figures and replicas.
